# Title: Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week-4-Assignment

## Author: Araf Toa Sanjeed Khan
## Date: 12.07.2020

## Code Book
"tidy.txt" contains average of each variable for each activity and each subject  

# Size
Data in dataset contains 180 rows and 563 columns for
•mean(): Mean value

# Grouping
The base data is grouped by the following values to build mean value

•subject - The ID of the test subject

•activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

# Activity
The 30 subject are numbered sequentially from 1 to 30. Activity column has 6 types as listed below

1.WALKING

2.WALKING_UPSTAIRS

3.WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

4.SITTING

5.STANDING

6.LAYING

#Measurements of the tidy dataset

Please note following changes were made to make the variables names sensible:
1. t = Time
2. Acc = Acceleration
3. [Gg]yro = Gyroscope
4. [Mm]ag = Magnitude
5. f = Frequency
6. BodyBody = Body
7. All dots (.) were removed and spaces were introduced
8. Trailing & leading spaces were removes; More than 1 spaces were merged into single space
